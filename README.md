# PowerliftProject

Problem statement
--------------------
Powerlifting is a sport where there is several equipment and weight classes. Ofcourse different equipment and weightclasses will lead to different results. The goal of this project is to visualize the effects that different equipment and weightclasses have on the squat, deadlift and benchpress. This is being done for the male and female department together and seperately. 


Solution
--------------------
The visualisations will show the effects of different equipment and weight classes on the results in powerlifting, for both the male and females. 


Prerequisites
--------------------

### Data sources. 

The data can be found here (download openpowerlifting.zip): [OpenPowerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/data.html). There was no need to transform the data.

### External components.

d3-tip library 

### Similar. 

Here is a link to a similar project: [towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/powerlifting-data-and-exploratory-data-analysis-part-1-6f21d79ac5db). In this project scatterplots and barcharts are used. The scatterplots are used to show the impact of bodyweight on the best lift, per lift. The barcharts are used to show the amount of people that had a specific best lift. There are no interactive elements and the influence of the equipment and division is not shown here. In my project I am planning to show this as well. 

### Hardest parts. 

There are a lot of divisions so it will be hard to show all the divisions in one spiderchart.
