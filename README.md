# PowerliftProject

Problem statement
--------------------
Powerlifting is a sport where are several weight classes, divisions and equipment. Ofcourse different equipment and weightclasses, and also divisions, will lead to different results in powerlifting. The goal of this project is to visualize the effects that different equipment, weightclasses and divisions have on the squat, deadlift and benchpress. This is being done for the male and female department together and seperately. 


Solution
--------------------
The visualisations will show the effects of different equipment and weight classes on the results in powerlifting, for both the male and females. Here is the sketch for the project: [OpenPowerlifting](https://github.com/Markvdhoven/PowerliftProject/blob/master/doc/projectSketch.JPG)


Prerequisites
--------------------

### Data sources. 

The data can be found here (download openpowerlifting.zip): [OpenPowerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/data.html). There was no need to transform the data.

### External components.

d3-tip library: [d3-tip](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip)

### Similar. 

Here is a link to a similar project: [towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/powerlifting-data-and-exploratory-data-analysis-part-1-6f21d79ac5db). In this project scatterplots and barcharts are used. The scatterplots are used to show the impact of bodyweight on the best lift, per lift. The barcharts are used to show the amount of people that had a specific best lift. There are no interactive elements and the influence of the equipment and division is not shown here. In my project I am planning to show this as well. 

### Hardest parts. 

There are a lot of divisions so it will be hard to show all the divisions in one spiderchart.
