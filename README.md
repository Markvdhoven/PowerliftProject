Usability
--------------------
The database consists of 600.000+ competetors. This is why the data is split up into different files. You should first select 
a database based on the first letter of the first name of the competetor. When you skip the step the visualisations will show all competetors which first names start with U or V (since this is the smallest database so it takes less time to load the page). After this it is also possible to look up a competetor:
