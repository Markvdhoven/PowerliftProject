Purpose
--------------------
The goal of this project is to determine corralition between the bodyweight, equipment and age of lifters and their results in powerlifting.

Usability
--------------------
The database consists of 600.000+ competators. This is why the data is split up into different files. You should first select 
a database based on the first letter of the first name of the competator. When you skip the step the visualisations will show all competators which first names start with U or V (since this is the smallest database so it takes less time to load the page). After this it is also possible to look up a competator:

It is also possible to select a lift, sex and equipment you want to visualize. When you skip this step it will show squat, male and raw:

Changing these qualities will change the visualisations below. The scatterplot will show the relationship between competator's 
lifts and bodyweight:

When you click on a dot in the scatterplot, or look up a name in the search bar, the barchart of a competator's personal 
results will be updated accordingly:

The boxplots show the results per equipment, based on the lift and sex you selected:

When a box in the boxplot is clicked on, it will update the spiderchart below. This shows the percentage of the total weight lifted that each age group can lift:
