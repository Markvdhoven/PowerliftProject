Short description
------------------------------------
I made a scatterplot, barchart, boxplots and a radarchart. The scatterplot
shows the relation betweens contesters bodyweight and a lift. When clicked on a
dot, the personal results of this contesters in shown in the barchart. The
boxplot shows the results per equipment. When you click on a box in this boxplots,
the results per age devision can be seen in the spiderchart (for this devision).
