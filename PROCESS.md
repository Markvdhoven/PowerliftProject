# day 3
Today I made a scatterplot, on the x-axis there is bodyweight on the y-axis
the best bench press. The dataset consists of 25.000 competetors.

# day 4
Today I included a html element, here you can select which lift you want on
the y-axis, which sex (male or female) and which equipment you want to see
in the scatterplot.

# day 5
Presentation day

# day 6
Today I linked the scatterplot to the barchart. When you click on a dot in
the scatterplot you can now see the personal results of that competetor.

# day 7
Today I created the boxplots for each equipment.

# day 8
Today I started with formatting the data the right way for the spiderchart.

# day 9
Today I finished the formatting of the data for the spiderchart and I created
the spiderchart.

# day 10
Presentation day

# day 11
Today I made a search bar. Here you can look for contesters in the database,
and the barchart will be updated and the dots in the scatterplot will be
highlighted accordingly.

# day 12
Today I splitted the data into parts, such that is it now possible to visualize
all the data. It is now possible to look up a lifter in the entire database by
first selecting the first letter of his first name and then looking him up.

# day 13
Today I made a menu bar, here you can select other pages such as the home page
and contact page.

# day 14
Today I finished the home page and the contact page. I also made some small changes
the the visualisations, such as a different hoovering style.

# day 15
Presentation day

# day 16
Today I changed the code such that the barcharts gets updated instead of removed. Also I made the search bar case insensitive.

# day 17
Today I changed to code such that the scatterplot gets updated instead of removed.
Also I made more small function in the code instead of very large functions.
